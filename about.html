<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="./Pictureofme.png" height="400" alt="Picture of Eric" />

<p>My name is Eric Zevallos and I've lived my whole life in the state of Idaho. I travel as much as I can on my days off whether 
  it's a new country, state, or just hiking finding new trails out in the mountains around Boise. I'm an active person that likes 
  working out but I'm also a huge foodie and always have cheat days.
